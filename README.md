# homework-seven

## Homework instructions and web4 link

You must create a project named homework-seven.
Your pages must look like the prototype. Your text must look good. 
All of these pages are similar to the ones we have done earlier in the site. 
Your page must be responsive. 
You can align the elements as you wish but they must look good and not touch the sides of the browser.
Upload your project to Github and add your Web4 link to the README file.
